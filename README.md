# password-generator-w3

## Description

I have been tasked to create a password generator based on criteria selected by the user. I have utilised dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code, using question prompts and confirmation prompts given to the user. This then generated a randomised password between 8-128 characters that possibly drew characters from four different character set options. This password is then written directly to the page.

## Development

While the code is working I did struggle with the placement of the code, I had to re-arrange code in ways that did not initially expect in order to make the code run correctly. I would like to improve my understanding of code placement and better understand the logic of how the code is run sequentially. I also struggled with the idea that variables in this case were not necessarily "true" if selected by the prompt. I will better research how prompts and boolean conditions interact. 

I decided to add comments as I added in code rather than at the end and I think this was beneficial in the sense that it encouraged me to stop and think through what my intentions were during the project more often. 

## Usage

The HTML and CSS code of this challenge was already pre-provided to me. As seen below, the visual of the website remains the same and you can see a 128 character long password using all the character sets required to include (uppercase, lowercase, number and special characters.)

## Credits

In response to feedback I received in my last module challenge feedback I have changed the naming convention of my challenges from beginning with "w#" to adding this to the end of the repo title. I also used "node" for the .gitignore file in order to hide my ".DS_Store" files from appearing in the repo. 

I have heavily relied on lessons taught through the module 3 lessons of the bootcamp; copying and then editing code from the lessons of this module to fit my needs. I also benefited from advice given directly by our tutors. I also did some minor googling to receive information that I did not use heavily enough to require attribution.
